# SushiVFXs
This project uses [AtelierBrown's](https://brown.tokyo/) [sushi scan assets](https://ddd.pink/product/j-food04/) to create some Unity VFX graphs.
It does not include the models since they're free to download but no redistributable.
This was done following [Keijiro Takahashi's](https://github.com/keijiro) video guides and tips with the aim of recreating his effects.
